MQTT is a lightweight IoT messaging protocol based on the publish/subscribe model, which provides a real-time and reliable messaging service for IoT devices, only using very little code and bandwidth. It is suitable for devices with limited hardware resources and a network environment with limited bandwidth. Therefore, the MQTT protocol is widely used.

This repo mainly presents how to use the paho-MQTT client and execute connection, subscribe, messaging, and other functions between the client and MQTT broker.
